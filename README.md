### The Damn Copression Wizard


The damn compression wizard is a command line app that compresses text using the Huffman code, which is very intuitive and smart, unless you are forced to write it in a single C/C++ file (even without utilizing header files) as instructed by our collage Teaching assistant. yet another reason why collage is dumb. what could have turned into a beautiful app for lossless text compression will be a pile of crap. If you are an imployer looking thro my code please understand the corner i am backed into, this is not how i would write code this is just coming of a place of fearing for my grades and no more. please refer to other projects.
