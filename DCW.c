The Delightful Compression Wizard is a command line app that takes in an input text file
(has to be named input.txt) and compress it losslessly using Huffman code.
The code will be WET, it is a requirement that we only use C/C++ files and no header file can comply with that.
I will try to maintain basic DRY principle around the file and perhaps organize it as much as humanly possible.
